## **üöÄ Alpha Version**

If you'd like to try the alpha version of Flux, you can download the installer `.exe` from the repository or directly from this link:

-   **Exe Location in Repo**: `flux/install/install_flux.exe`
-   **Download Link**: [Flux Installer](https://github.com/iamgautamsuthar/flux/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/install_flux.exe)

### How to Install:

1. Download the `.exe` file from the link or repository.
2. **Run it as Admin**. If Windows Defender blocks it, simply click on **"Run anyway"**.
    - Please note that this warning occurs because we don't have a publisher license. It's completely safe, and you can review the installation script (`install_flux.ps1`) to verify its safety.
